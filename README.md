<h1 id="Introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This README provides a summary of a To-Do app I created to demonstrate my knowledge of ASP.NET Core 8.0 and the MVC framework. Merging aesthetics with functionality, my goal was to deliver a user-friendly and visually pleasing app which also incorporated the features of ASP.NET Core. To provide the user with a feel of hand-written notes, which I felt complemented the theme of to-do lists, I utilized the "Sketchy" theme from Bootswatch.</p>

<p>The CRUD operations were pretty straighforward. Since the app is supposed to be a simple to-do list, I wanted to make sure users were able to quickly add tasks and get them off their mind.</p>
